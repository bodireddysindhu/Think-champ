<h2 style="background-color: yellow">What is in the head? </h2>
Meta data in HTML
The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the in web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page <title>, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).
<h2 style="background-color: yellow">HTML text fundamentals:</h2>
One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.

In this article, you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.
<h2 style="background-color: yellow">Document and website structure:</h2>
As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML is also used to define areas of your website (such as "the header," "the navigation menu," or "the main content column.") This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to write the HTML to represent this structure.
