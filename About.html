    <h2>what is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      CSS is the acronym of "Cascading Style Sheets". CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files .
    </p>
    <h2> Purpose of CSS:</h2>
<p> CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language <a href="S2.html">see more</a></p>

       Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.</p> <p> Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

   <p> Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.</p>


<u>Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:</u><br>

<ol><li>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.</li>
<li>Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.</li>
<li>Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.</li>
<li>Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.</li></ol>
The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:<br>
Machine Learning
GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
Test frameworks
Multimedia
Scientific computing
Text processing and many more..<a href="S3.html">see more</a>
       <li style="font-size: 30px">ETHICAL HACKING</li>
  <center><img src="Images/49.jpg" width="300px" height="300px"></center>
       <p> 
       Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.

<p>Also known as "white hats," ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization’s security posture. With prior approval from the organization or owner of the IT asset, the mission of ethical hacking is opposite from malicious hacking. </p>

<p><span style="background-color: skyblue;font-size: 30px">What are the key concepts of ethical hacking?</span></p>
Hacking experts follow four key protocol concepts:
<br>
<span style="background-color: yellow">Stay legal.</span><br> Obtain proper approval before accessing and performing a security assessment.<br>
<span style="background-color: yellow">Define the scope.</span><br> Determine the scope of the assessment so that the ethical hacker’s work remains legal and within the organization’s approved boundaries.<br>
<span style="background-color: yellow">Report vulnerabilities. </span><br>Notify the organization of all vulnerabilities discovered during the assessment. Provide remediation advice for resolving these vulnerabilities.<br>
<span style="background-color: yellow">Respect data sensitivity.</span><br> Depending on the data sensitivity, ethical hackers may have to agree to a non-disclosure agreement, in addition to other terms and conditions required by the assessed organization<a href="S4.html">see more</a></p>
