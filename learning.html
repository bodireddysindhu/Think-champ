<h3 style="color:blue">*&nbsp;Online learning saves us time and means we can learn on the go; so it eliminates the boundaries of the classroom.<br> <br>
*&nbsp;It enables us to easily learn about the world and gain better skills.<br><br>
*&nbsp;However, this easier access to information means the academic requirements facing students can also be more demanding.<br><br>

*&nbsp;Online learning may bring a lot of advantages to students.<br><br> 
*&nbsp;They can use e-books, so their schoolbags will be much lighter.<br><br></h3>
