  <h1 style="color: blueviolet;font-size: 50px">History</h1>
<p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s[39] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[40] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its implementation began in December 1989.[41] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[42] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a 5-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.[43] As of 2021, the current members of this council are Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Carol Willing, Thomas Wouters, and Pablo Galindo Salgado.[44]</p>

<p><span style="background-color: yellow">Python 2.0</span> was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[45]</p>

<p><span style="background-color: yellow">Python 3.0 </span>was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[46] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[47] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[48]</p>

<p><span style="background-color: yellow">Python 2.7</span>end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[49][50] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[51][52] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[53] and later are supported.</p>

<p>Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[54] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[55]) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution[56] and web cache poisoning.[57]</p>
<h1>Features of python</h1>
  <p>Python is a<span style="color: blue"> multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming</span> and <span style="color: blue">structured programming </span>are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and<span style="color: blue"> aspect-oriented programming</span> (including by <span style="color: blue">metaprogramming<sup>[58] </sup></span>and<span style="color: blue"> metaobjects (magic methods)).<sup>[59] </sup></span>Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including <span style="color: blue">design by contract<sup>[60][61]</sup></span> and logic programming.[62]</p>

<p>Python uses <span style="color: blue">dynamic typing</span> and a combination of<span style="color: blue"> reference counting </span>and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[63] It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.</p>


<p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[66]</p>

<ul><li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li></ul>
Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly <span style="color: blue">extensible</span> (with modules). This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with <span style="color: blue">ABC</span> ,which espoused the opposite approach.[39]
